phpQr - A QRCode encoder class
===

by Maik Greubel (greubel@nkey.de)

The intention to create a basic qrcode encoder for PHP was a request on phpclasses.org.

The author studied multiple sources to get an idea how qrcode implementation works under the hood. 
The best source was the JavaScript library jquery which provides a HTML Table based implementation.
See source and documentation at  <https://github.com/jeromeetienne/jquery-qrcode>

So the hard work was already done by Jerome Etienne. My part was only to port it to PHP code.

Currently this package does not have the capability to read QRCodes.
